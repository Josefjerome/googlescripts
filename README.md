# Welcome

Welcome to my first attempt at using public git to chronicle some of my shareable work. My name is Joseph Curtis, software developer living in Jamaica; Father to one son, and husband to one wife. I have been coding a while now, but have not transitioned to the sharing of my codesets.

It is my hope, I'll get better at this... and also be sure to include resources that I have either forked code from, or through some theory included aspects of their thought into the codebase.

## Google Scripts

My wife need to put a Out of Office message functionality into our Google Mail managed account: if I am being totally honest, I was just trying to get the after hour mail checking to just stop.


So there is:
* AutoReply Script
*details to be posted later*

* Convert Shedul.com __New Appointment__ mails to a google calendar entry.
*details to be posted later*
