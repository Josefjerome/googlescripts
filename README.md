## Google Scripts

My wife need to put a Out of Office message functionality into our Google Mail managed account: if I am being totally honest, I was just trying to get the after hour mail checking to just stop.


So there is:
* AutoReply Script
*details to be posted later*

* Convert Shedul.com __New Appointment__ mails to a google calendar entry.
*details to be posted later*
